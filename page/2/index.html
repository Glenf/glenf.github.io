I enjoy whisky. Single malt Scotch whisky to be precise. But I do like any good or great whisky. And every now and then me and my friends order some from an e-commerce site. On one of those occasions I stumbled on Auchentoshan. I had never tasted or even heard of it. Valinch had very good ratings so I decided to try it. And it was a positive surprise form me. After that I think I&rsquo;ve ordered atleast one Auchentoshan bottle a year. And it has never failed. This time it&rsquo;s Three Wood. And I&rsquo;m enjoying another Auchentoshan.

Today I came home from my first work day after summer vacation. Had some dinner and wen tfor some errands in hardware store. When I came back my daughter sais she&rsquo;s going for her football practise with her bike. And I&rsquo;d be running beside her. This is something we&rsquo;ve discussed but never done. So there was really no other option for me. I had promised this so I had to keep my promise. So I did. I left my girl at her practise and ran back home. 4 kilometers of pain and last 1,9 kilometers pure joy. Loved it.

I did some real life Minecrafting today. Moved some more soil today. Maybe around 10 cubic meters. It&rsquo;s nothing like Minecraf. I&rsquo;ve got an iron shovel and all but still it takes very long time to get the wheelbarrow full. And it gets sweaty pretty fast. No fast way to get 64 pieces of soil to inventory and then stack them in another place. But that is real life. There&rsquo;s about 6 cubic meters of soil left to move. But first I&rsquo;ll have to even the moved soil so I&rsquo;ll know better where to move the rest.

My eldest started a hobby this summer. Football. She learned that a friend of hers is on a new team in this area. My wife took a chance and brought her to the training. And they were taking new players. She&rsquo;s been playing for almost two months now and they hade their first practice games. I went to see how they play. There was a lot of running after the ball. But it wasn&rsquo;t really football. Not yet. It did resemble football. But they had fun. And that&rsquo;s the main reason for hobbies. They have time to learn.

I&rsquo;d want to call myself a gamer. But really I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m more like a spectator. I like to watch other people play games. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I do like to play also. But mostly with someone else. Throught network or in the same room. At the same time or in turns. The games I like the most are co-ops. You&rsquo;re both doing things for common purpose. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I suck at the game. I think this is mainly because I got my first console last christmas. Before that my gaming was very casual.

<p>
Today started the last phase of my summer vacation roof maintenance. I dropped down our houses old gutters. I&rsquo;m guessing those are original which makes them 47 years old. Or maybe they have been replaced at some point but that must be at least two decades ago. The gutters were rusty and the paint was shattered. I&rsquo;ll have to change a few bad boards and paint them before the new gutters can be installed. If it wont rain I&rsquo;ll have most of the boards installed and painted in a few days. But we all know how plans work out.
