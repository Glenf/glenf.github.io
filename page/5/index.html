Yesterday was a day I did nothing. For the most part of the day at least. It started in the morning and ended in the late afternoon. Oh the joy of doing nothing. Just laying around. Fiddling with my phone. Listening to the kids playing. Wife laying beside me an reading a book. Doing nothing. But as I&rsquo;ve done something for a very long time it&rsquo;s hard for me to do nothing. So late in the afternoon I finally had to get up and do something. So I did a small maintenance to my car.

This summer hasn&rsquo;t been that hot. June was all rain and this month has been a little less rainy. I&rsquo;d call this temperature perfect but it seems that generally people want summer to be warmer than 15°C. Yesterday the sun shone. And it was a bit too warm. We had our roof ready to be painted. Most of the day we had to do something else because our red metal roof was too hot for the paint. The painting started around six in the evening and four hours later half the roof was painted. Today it rains.

<p>
As I mentioned previously we are repainting our roof. I&rsquo;m not sure if our roof has ever been repainted or if the paint job has just been fixed here and there. Anyway a 47 year old roof deserves a repaint. So yesterday was all about cleaning. 180 square meters of tin roof. Cleaning with pressure washer, brushing with detergent which includes a fair amount of ammonium, rinsing with water and scraping all rust out. Fortunately I got help from my brother and my sisters partner. Still it took 15 hours to get a clean roof. Now it&rsquo;s painting time.

<p>
As a home owner I&rsquo;ve learned that things tend to cost. Some things cost more than others. We had to replace our oil tank last year and it ate our vacation budjet. We weren&rsquo;t prepared for it. But luckily our old oil tank was found faulty before any oil was leaked. It would have cost us a lot more. This summer I&rsquo;m repainting our roof. Another bigger cost. But couple of years ahead without repainting and our roof might need a replacement. About ten times the cost. Some times it helps to thing about the alternative cost.

Yesterday was a nice day. Sun was shining and there was a little breeze. Just enough to keep those pesky little mosquitos away. And I was on the roof building a casting mold to our chimney crown. It was a simple but time consuming thing to do. Mainly because I&rsquo;m an amateur in doing stuff like this. I learn as I go. I the same at work. I know something and learn from there. The key thing in learning is to fail fast. Then you have the time to fix things. And do it right in future.

<p>
I&rsquo;m a concerned dad. My oldest is seven years old. She can do things with her own. Without me looking after her. She is a bit shy which I think is a good thing. I don&rsquo;t have to be that concerned. But still every time she goes to her friend I&rsquo;m a bit worried about the things that might happen. I think it&rsquo;s just a part of parenthood and me learning things. I might give her my old iPhone so I could track her. But no! I should let her have independece in her own little world. Without tracking.
