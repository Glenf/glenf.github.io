<p>
We have three dogs. Labrador retrievers. Fun dogs. Most of the times. Some times they do annoying stuff like eat socks or vormit to a carpet. But that&rsquo;s just how they are. The old ones, 13 and 10 years are getting slow. But the youngest one, one year old is just starting her life. Her name is Lysti. As name suggests she&rsquo;s full of joy, energy and wants to please. Every time we go for a walk she puts her nose down to the ground and starts sniffing. Someone has said that dogs eases stress. Most times that&rsquo;s true.

<p>
I love sideprojects. I&rsquo;ve got a few always on. The one I like the most is a site I&rsquo;ve maintained for a while now. A local movie theatre site. It&rsquo;s a fun project because I&rsquo;m allowed to do anything with it. As long as it&rsquo;s up and keeps the business running. It&rsquo;s also the one that shows my progress as a front end developer the best. I update or refactor only a part of the site at a time so there&rsquo;s some really old code there. And because of that old code I can see how good I&rsquo;ve come.

<p>
I believe that by doing lists you can accomplish more things that you might know. And it suprises even me every nown and then. But there&rsquo;s a catch in those lists. You have to put things you know you can do. You have to have the resources or a possibility for those recources. Like time and money. You also have to arrange the tasks so that you know what&rsquo;s important and what&rsquo;s nice to have. And the external dependencies (like weather) have to be acknowledged. After that it&rsquo;s just doing. And checking things off from the list.

<p>
We got a new vacuum cleaner last Chirstmas. Not as a Christmast present but as a replacement for our old one. Our old one was a working but it was loud and it didn&rsquo;t suck much. And as a vacuum cleaner that is an important thing. But this new one, our current, it does suck. And it&rsquo;s quiet. It keeps some noise but much less than the old one. One problem it has. It sucks so effectively that the dust bag has to be changed more often than with our previous one. But I can live with that.

<p>
We ordered 24 cubic meters of soil to our property. A big pile of dirt. And a heavy pile also. We&rsquo;ve been moving it with our wheelbarrow to a small pit we have on our property. And filling it up has been a slow process. Basically I&rsquo;ve done other things and wife has been moving the soil. Today was the first day I moved it. And my back is sore from the shoveling. But I managed to move quite a lot of it to the pit. Before it started raining. A lot. It has been a really rainy summer.

<p>
We went hiking yesterday. Only for a few hours but still. We had our youngest dog with us and she was enjoying it. It was a short hike mainly because of a thunder and rain. For a part of the rain we held shelter in a small hut. We made some coffee in a campfire. I do love campfire. There&rsquo;s something soothing about the sound of a fire. And the coffee made with open fire can&rsquo;t be compared to anything else. It doesn&rsquo;t really taste any better. But it&rsquo;s the ritual that counts. It&rsquo;s what makes the coffee enjoyable.
