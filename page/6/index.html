Some days just don&rsquo;t start. First it&rsquo;s morning and suddenly it&rsquo;s late afternoon. And you wonder where did the day go. It happened to me once again. Fired up PS4 an playde Minecraft with kids for about two hours. But not to worry, my wife had a day off from work. She forced me to do real things. So I had to put my work trousers on and get out. I got our chimney finished. Only the crown is missing. Also got our Renault yearly maintenance done. Changed oils and filters. Now she&rsquo;ll run for another year.

Yesterday was a rainy day. It didn&rsquo;t rain much. It was a drizzle. But still enough to keep me and my kids inside. We watched some Netflix. Kids painted with watercolours. And I tried to find a web ui for Github pages. Then we went to the hardware store to get some more mortar. And to a computer store. I bought a second controller to my PS4. And Minecraft. I&rsquo;ve never played Minecraft but my seven year old daughter said it&rsquo;s good. Now it&rsquo;s waiting in the shelf to be opened and played. So just another normal day.

I own a house. We own it. We have a mortage for it. And as a part of owning a house you have to maintain it. Every day. Some tasks are small, some are large. Some tasks are similar as if you were just renting a flat, like cleaning. Some require skill. Sometimes you have to hire someone to do the task. But most times it&rsquo;s just something you&rsquo;ll have to learn. Like masonry. I&rsquo;ve never done it. Still I got our chimney repair nearly complete. Just finishing touches and that&rsquo;s it. Just waiting for the rain to stop.

<p>
Yesterday I started tearing down our chimney. Well actually repairing. But it means the top part has to be dismantled. I had my brother helping me and in couple of hours we had the chimney torn down. Not totally, the top part only. That is the part I have to repair. Some of the seams were completely missing or the mortar had turned to sand. Only a few bricks needed the help of a small hammer to be removed. Most of them we could just pick up with bare hands. 40 years is alot for a chimney.
