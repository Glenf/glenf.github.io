Our eldest is learning to read watch. Next fall she is going to school so it&rsquo;s very important for her to know what time it is. I bought her a watch a few months ago and she&rsquo;ll have to take care of it herself. Remember to take it off and put it back on. Yesterday her watch was lost. It couldn&rsquo;t be found anywhere. And she was sad. She couldn&rsquo;t go to play with her friend. Dad to rescue and the watch was found. It was on a shelf in our bathroom. She had fun playing with her friend.

We do like strawberries. My wife likes them fresh. I don&rsquo;t care that much. Frozen or fresh. As long as they&rsquo;re domestic. I had some strawberries yesterday. Fresh but from Sweden. Those were quite good but not as sweet as I&rsquo;d like them to be. It must be the travel part that spoils them. Or some other part of the supply chain. I bet that those swedish strawberries would taste better in Sweden than here. It&rsquo;s the same with frosen Polish strawberries. When comparing to domestic self-frozen strawberries the taste isn&rsquo;t as sweet. But still I&rsquo;d eat them.

My brother wanted to borrow my car. For a weekend trip with his friends. His Corolla is a bit small compared to my Galant STW. So obviously I had to check my car was good for the trip. I finally had to fix my windscreen washer motor wich broke in the winter. Haven&rsquo;t had much use for it. I also removed a bunch of previous owners custom wire installs. My brother took the car and called back. No working indicators. About 30 minutes later I realised I was a bit too eager with the wire removal stuff.

Yesterday was a day I did nothing. For the most part of the day at least. It started in the morning and ended in the late afternoon. Oh the joy of doing nothing. Just laying around. Fiddling with my phone. Listening to the kids playing. Wife laying beside me an reading a book. Doing nothing. But as I&rsquo;ve done something for a very long time it&rsquo;s hard for me to do nothing. So late in the afternoon I finally had to get up and do something. So I did a small maintenance to my car.

<p>
This summer hasn&rsquo;t been that hot. June was all rain and this month has been a little less rainy. I&rsquo;d call this temperature perfect but it seems that generally people want summer to be warmer than 15°C. Yesterday the sun shone. And it was a bit too warm. We had our roof ready to be painted. Most of the day we had to do something else because our red metal roof was too hot for the paint. The painting started around six in the evening and four hours later half the roof was painted. Today it rains.

<p>
As I mentioned previously we are repainting our roof. I&rsquo;m not sure if our roof has ever been repainted or if the paint job has just been fixed here and there. Anyway a 47 year old roof deserves a repaint. So yesterday was all about cleaning. 180 square meters of tin roof. Cleaning with pressure washer, brushing with detergent which includes a fair amount of ammonium, rinsing with water and scraping all rust out. Fortunately I got help from my brother and my sisters partner. Still it took 15 hours to get a clean roof. Now it&rsquo;s painting time.
