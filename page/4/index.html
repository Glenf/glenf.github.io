<p>
We ordered 24 cubic meters of soil to our property. A big pile of dirt. And a heavy pile also. We&rsquo;ve been moving it with our wheelbarrow to a small pit we have on our property. And filling it up has been a slow process. Basically I&rsquo;ve done other things and wife has been moving the soil. Today was the first day I moved it. And my back is sore from the shoveling. But I managed to move quite a lot of it to the pit. Before it started raining. A lot. It has been a really rainy summer.

<p>
We went hiking yesterday. Only for a few hours but still. We had our youngest dog with us and she was enjoying it. It was a short hike mainly because of a thunder and rain. For a part of the rain we held shelter in a small hut. We made some coffee in a campfire. I do love campfire. There&rsquo;s something soothing about the sound of a fire. And the coffee made with open fire can&rsquo;t be compared to anything else. It doesn&rsquo;t really taste any better. But it&rsquo;s the ritual that counts. It&rsquo;s what makes the coffee enjoyable.

<p>
Our roof is painted. It took a while but it is finally painted. Our chimney isn&rsquo;t finished yet. I had to change my roof schedule because of the weather forecasts and our planned small summer trip. And now I&rsquo;m having three days off from house repair and maintenance with my wife and dogs. Our kids are having their summer trip with my mother, sister and sisters son. So we rented a cabing, packed our car and drove away from home. It&rsquo;s good for the mind to get away from home every now and then. Get some real rest.

<p>
Our eldest is learning to read watch. Next fall she is going to school so it&rsquo;s very important for her to know what time it is. I bought her a watch a few months ago and she&rsquo;ll have to take care of it herself. Remember to take it off and put it back on. Yesterday her watch was lost. It couldn&rsquo;t be found anywhere. And she was sad. She couldn&rsquo;t go to play with her friend. Dad to rescue and the watch was found. It was on a shelf in our bathroom. She had fun playing with her friend.

<p>
We do like strawberries. My wife likes them fresh. I don&rsquo;t care that much. Frozen or fresh. As long as they&rsquo;re domestic. I had some strawberries yesterday. Fresh but from Sweden. Those were quite good but not as sweet as I&rsquo;d like them to be. It must be the travel part that spoils them. Or some other part of the supply chain. I bet that those swedish strawberries would taste better in Sweden than here. It&rsquo;s the same with frosen Polish strawberries. When comparing to domestic self-frozen strawberries the taste isn&rsquo;t as sweet. But still I&rsquo;d eat them.

<p>
My brother wanted to borrow my car. For a weekend trip with his friends. His Corolla is a bit small compared to my Galant STW. So obviously I had to check my car was good for the trip. I finally had to fix my windscreen washer motor wich broke in the winter. Haven&rsquo;t had much use for it. I also removed a bunch of previous owners custom wire installs. My brother took the car and called back. No working indicators. About 30 minutes later I realised I was a bit too eager with the wire removal stuff.
