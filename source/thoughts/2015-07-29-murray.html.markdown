I got a riding lawn mower for free. A Murray 5/25. I think it's from the 80's or something. It has been neglected for a while and was looking a bit out of shape. One tire was flat, back tires didn't turn freely, engine didn't start and it was dirty all over. Before I'd fix anythin else I'd had to get it running. So I did a little cleanup and checked that the engine got spark. Then I removed the air cleaner and tried to start the engine. It did run. Very loudly. Next up, gearbox maintenance.
