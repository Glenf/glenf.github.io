title: Mr. Robot
---

Every now and then comes a movie or a tv show that surprises me completely. The Matrix was one. Cloud Atlas was another. And now Mr. Robot. What gets me in these is that I've got some sort of expectation but I still don't know what I'll see or get. In Mr. Robot I really enjoy how real the hacking feels. I din't see that coming. Especially after what Hollywood has done to it. Also this series makes me feel completely unsafe. It's not because of the hackers but because of the companies I trust my data with.
