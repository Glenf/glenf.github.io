# Dog

We have three dogs. Labrador retrievers. Fun dogs. Most of the times. Some times they do annoying stuff like eat socks or vormit to a carpet. But that's just how they are. The old ones, 13 and 10 years are getting slow. But the youngest one, one year old is just starting her life. Her name is Lysti. As name suggests she's full of joy, energy and wants to please. Every time we go for a walk she puts her nose down to the ground and starts sniffing. Someone has said that dogs eases stress. Most times that's true.
