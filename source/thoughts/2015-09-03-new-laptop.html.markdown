title: New laptop
---

I started a new project. It's the kind what has to be done on clients hardware. So I recieved a new MacBook Pro. 2015 with force touch and the new keyboard. I've been using it for couple of days now but there's something in the feel that is off. The previous MBP keyboard wasn't that good coding keyboard and this new one feels even more wrong. And the clickless click on the new trackpad. There is something weird about how it works. I might be over sensitive on this subject but sometimes things just don't click. Pun intended.
