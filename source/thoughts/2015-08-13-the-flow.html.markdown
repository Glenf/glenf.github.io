title: The Flow
---

I'm going to take a break after I do this. In a sec. Just a little moment and then I'll go. And that moment stretches to an hour or two. And the posture is all wrong because of all the sitting in the edge of the seat. Spine all twisted. Shoulders collapsed. I know my muscles will ache later but I don't really pay attention to my body. Or outside world. The Flow has me. Code comes easily. Making awesome things. Only thing breaking the Flow is calendar alarm reminding me to pick my kids up after work.
