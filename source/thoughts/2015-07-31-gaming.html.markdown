I'd want to call myself a gamer. But really I'm not. I'm more like a spectator. I like to watch other people play games. Don't get me wrong, I do like to play also. But mostly with someone else. Throught network or in the same room. At the same time or in turns. The games I like the most are co-ops. You're both doing things for common purpose. And it doesn't matter if I suck at the game. I think this is mainly because I got my first console last christmas. Before that my gaming was very casual.
