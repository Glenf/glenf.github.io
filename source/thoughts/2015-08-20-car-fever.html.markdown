title: Car fever
---

Summer is ending and the fall is coming. And I have a car fever. It's partly because couple of my coworkers have or are changing cars. The second reason is my current car, Mitsubishi. I've had it for almost two years now. It's a good car but I tend to change my cars in around three years. There are few exceptions. But my Mitsubishi, it's starting to cost a bit too much. For an 800€ car a 400€ repair seems too much. Then again, 400€ or 5000€ for a car. That's the maths I should be consentrating to.
