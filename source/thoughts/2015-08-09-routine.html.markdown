title: Routine
---

My routine is broken. Not all my routines but my writing one. I started writing things down every day last month. It went fine because every day I had a time when I'd write. Usually at morning after breakfast. A few occasions I wrote at the evening before I went to bed but mostly the writing happened in the morning. Until I started my work again. Now after breakfast I leave for work. And at work I've not had the same kind of routine in writing that I had at home. It seems I'll have to change my routine.
