title: A slight panic
---

My daughter started her school. First half a week went fine. But first monday with new schedule was something new. An hour later and straight to classroom was a bit too much. There was no-one outside to take her inside. So she paniced a little She rode her bike back to home and called my wife who called me to help. I called her and told to go back to school. I drove to her school from work and calmed her down. Then I explained the situation to her teacher. It all went well from there.
