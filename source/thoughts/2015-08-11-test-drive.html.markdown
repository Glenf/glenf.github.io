title: Test drive
---

Yesterday I had a long test drive with the lawnmover I've been repairing. When it came to me the gears didn't work and it didn't run that great. A little bit of fixing and a few new parts and it was running. Sort of. I still need to fix the carburettor and the steering but it cuts lawn. And the gears work. It is loud but simple muffler replacement should quiet things down. Considering that this lawnmover is from the 80's it's in a pretty good shape. Whith these fixes maybe another five years more to ride.
