I do web stuff for living. It's my job and hobby. But sometimes it's refreshing to do something that leaves a physical object behind. That's why I like to do stuff. Build, fix or tinker with stuff. Hopefully these things  take only a day or two. As a house owner there are maintenance things I need to do but I'm not talking about those things. I'm talking things like a tool holder on the wall or a Nexus 7 dock. I'm not doing these because there's need. I'm doing them because it takes my mind off of something else.
