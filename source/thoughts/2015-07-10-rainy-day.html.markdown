title: Rainy day
---

Yesterday was a rainy day. It didn't rain much. It was a drizzle. But still enough to keep me and my kids inside. We watched some Netflix. Kids painted with watercolours. And I tried to find a web ui for Github pages. Then we went to the hardware store to get some more mortar. And to a computer store. I bought a second controller to my PS4. And Minecraft. I've never played Minecraft but my seven year old daughter said it's good. Now it's waiting in the shelf to be opened and played. So just another normal day.
