I enjoy listening to podcasts. I think podcasts are like talk radio except the program is targeted better at your interests. But creating podcasts is even more enjoyable. I can share my ideas with other people. Usually it's only with my co-host. But I do hope there are other people also who enjoy listening us talking. I really don't care how many there are because I'm not doing this because of a large audience. The only thing I care is that maybe someone listening gets atleast some of the enthusiasm or spark I have for web development.
