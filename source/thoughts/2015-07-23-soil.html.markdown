title: Soil
---

We ordered 24 cubic meters of soil to our property. A big pile of dirt. And a heavy pile also. We've been moving it with our wheelbarrow to a small pit we have on our property. And filling it up has been a slow process. Basically I've done other things and wife has been moving the soil. Today was the first day I moved it. And my back is sore from the shoveling. But I managed to move quite a lot of it to the pit. Before it started raining. A lot. It has been a really rainy summer.
