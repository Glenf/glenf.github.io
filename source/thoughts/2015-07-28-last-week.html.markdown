title: Last week

My last summer vacation week has started. It's weird how the time just flies. When there's lots of stuff to do you don't count the days. Now that I've done most of the things I was supposed to to on my summer vacation I have time to count the remaining days. Which is not that bad. I'm already waiting to return to work. A promising new project and lots of ideas. Hopefully I'll have time to finish the stuff I started before I'll start my work. But then again, there are always weekends to do the finishing touches.
