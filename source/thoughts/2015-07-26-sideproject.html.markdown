title: Sideproject
---

I love sideprojects. I've got a few always on. The one I like the most is a site I've maintained for a while now. A local movie theatre site. It's a fun project because I'm allowed to do anything with it. As long as it's up and keeps the business running. It's also the one that shows my progress as a front end developer the best. I update or refactor only a part of the site at a time so there's some really old code there. And because of that old code I can see how good I've come.
