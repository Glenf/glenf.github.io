The summer is officially over and the fall has begun. How do I know this? The morning temperature has dropped below freezing point. And my nose has been cold in the morning. Now I'm just waiting for the time I'll finally have to tur our heating on. Every day or week I can keep heating off means a little longer time till I have to order more oil. But I'm not going to keep adding more shirts and socks on to keep me warm. I'm waiting for the moment the cold get annoying. Or my wife tells me to.
