title: Finishing projects
---

I have hard time to finish my projects. Not the work kind but the hobby and side project kind. I usually start them with enthusiasm but if the project takes a long time or gets lots of interruptions I tend to not finish it. Which is a bad thing. And I've started to pay attention to it. Which has made me feel guilty. And it doesn't really help me finish the project. Recently I've started to finish my projects. I't might have something to do with the fact that I don't want to feel guilty or bad anymore.
