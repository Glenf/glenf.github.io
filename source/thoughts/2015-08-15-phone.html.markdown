title: Phone

When I got my first phone I was 15 years old. The phone was Motorola MicroTAC. NMT phone. And when I got it it was already 5 years old. It was awesome. I could call all my friends if they had mobile phones. Some even had GSM phones, Nokias that could send text messages. My poor Moto didn't have that feature. My daughter got my old iPhone 4s. She's seven. And she has a phone that can do more than my computer back when I got my first phone. The times have truly changed. And that's a good thing.
