title: August

I like August. The summer is almost over and fall is coming. It gets dark but it's still warm. You can see the stars without getting cold. It's like everything is preparing for the winter but still enjoying every last warm day the summer has to offer. In a way August is like the place between sleep and awake. It's like the gentle transitionin from state to another. Soon it's fall. It rains, gets dark and cold. It is just miserable before the winter comes. The hard cold transitioning. I do like August. The final lingering kiss of summer.
