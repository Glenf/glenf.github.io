title: Learning by doing
---

Yesterday was a nice day. Sun was shining and there was a little breeze. Just enough to keep those pesky little mosquitos away. And I was on the roof building a casting mold to our chimney crown. It was a simple but time consuming thing to do. Mainly because I'm an amateur in doing stuff like this. I learn as I go. I the same at work. I know something and learn from there. The key thing in learning is to fail fast. Then you have the time to fix things. And do it right in future.
