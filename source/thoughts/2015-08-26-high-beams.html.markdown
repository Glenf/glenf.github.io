title: High beams
---

Yesterday I started installing auxiliary high beam lights to my mothers car. She works at night time so the more light the better. She came to our house with the lights and stuff needed for the installation. And I realised that installing aux lights to a newer car isn't as easy as install into an 15 years old car. The safety regulations have changed the way bumbers are installed. And there isn't really that much room in the engine bay. I got the install started and wiring mostly done. But I'll have to finish it in another afternoon.
