title: The chimney repair
---

Yesterday I started tearing down our chimney. Well actually repairing. But it means the top part has to be dismantled. I had my brother helping me and in couple of hours we had the chimney torn down. Not totally, the top part only. That is the part I have to repair. Some of the seams were completely missing or the mortar had turned to sand. Only a few bricks needed the help of a small hammer to be removed. Most of them we could just pick up with bare hands. 40 years is alot for a chimney.
