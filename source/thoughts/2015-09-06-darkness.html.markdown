title: Darkness
---

I like driving cars. And I like darkness. So driving in the dark is one of the greatest things I can do. Yesterday I drove from Rovaniemi to Oulu with my family. We left in the evening after our kids had eaten their porridge. After about an hour the back seat had quieted down and my wife had also closed her eyes. I was all alone in the car. The radio played something in the background. In a way this moment was one of the best things that had happened to me in a while. And I enjoyed it.
