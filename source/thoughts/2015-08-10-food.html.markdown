# Food

On my summer vacation I allowed myself to eat what I like. I didn't get all crazy because I had to consider my kids and wife also. So no "icecream all day". I just didn't pay that much attention to what I was eating. Now that I started working again it was time to pay attention to my eating habits and food. Mainly because I don't do my meals at home. I noticed once again that I eat too little. I don't starve but my calorie count should be higher. Again I'll have to learn how to eat enough.
