title: Too hot
---

This summer hasn't been that hot. June was all rain and this month has been a little less rainy. I'd call this temperature perfect but it seems that generally people want summer to be warmer than 15Â°C. Yesterday the sun shone. And it was a bit too warm. We had our roof ready to be painted. Most of the day we had to do something else because our red metal roof was too hot for the paint. The painting started around six in the evening and four hours later half the roof was painted. Today it rains.
