title: Old hardware
---

This weekend I finally reinstalled a custom ROM to our 2012 Nexus 7. The first Google Tablet. It's not really that old but the mobile operating systems tend to make over two years old hardware obsolete. Apple has made an exception including iPhone 4s in the upcoming iOS 9 update. Also the next OS X still supports my late 2007 24" iMac. Luckily Nexus 7 is easy to modify so there's the possibility to use custom build Android. With this custom ROM, Dirty Unicorns is the name, I managed to get some more life out of our tablet.
