Our dog Iida has passed away today. What an end to a week. I've known the date for a while now but it doesn't make things any easier. Last few days have been emotionally hard. I've had to act as normal because of our kids. It's easier to explain things after everythings done. And today I did, right after I got home from work. Our three year old didn't quite get what's happened but first grader did. So it was crying for a while and then some questions. I'm sure there'll be more later. But for our dog Iida, it's better this way.
