title: Masonry

I own a house. We own it. We have a mortage for it. And as a part of owning a house you have to maintain it. Every day. Some tasks are small, some are large. Some tasks are similar as if you were just renting a flat, like cleaning. Some require skill. Sometimes you have to hire someone to do the task. But most times it's just something you'll have to learn. Like masonry. I've never done it. Still I got our chimney repair nearly complete. Just finishing touches and that's it. Just waiting for the rain to stop.
