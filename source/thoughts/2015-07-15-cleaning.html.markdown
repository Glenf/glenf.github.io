# Cleaning

As I mentioned previously we are repainting our roof. I'm not sure if our roof has ever been repainted or if the paint job has just been fixed here and there. Anyway a 47 year old roof deserves a repaint. So yesterday was all about cleaning. 180 square meters of tin roof. Cleaning with pressure washer, brushing with detergent which includes a fair amount of ammonium, rinsing with water and scraping all rust out. Fortunately I got help from my brother and my sisters partner. Still it took 15 hours to get a clean roof. Now it's painting time.
