# Running

Today I came home from my first work day after summer vacation. Had some dinner and wen tfor some errands in hardware store. When I came back my daughter sais she's going for her football practise with her bike. And I'd be running beside her. This is something we've discussed but never done. So there was really no other option for me. I had promised this so I had to keep my promise. So I did. I left my girl at her practise and ran back home. 4 kilometers of pain and last 1,9 kilometers pure joy. Loved it.
