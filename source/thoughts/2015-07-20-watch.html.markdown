# Watch

Our eldest is learning to read watch. Next fall she is going to school so it's very important for her to know what time it is. I bought her a watch a few months ago and she'll have to take care of it herself. Remember to take it off and put it back on. Yesterday her watch was lost. It couldn't be found anywhere. And she was sad. She couldn't go to play with her friend. Dad to rescue and the watch was found. It was on a shelf in our bathroom. She had fun playing with her friend.
