title: School

My daughter went to first grade today. This is her first school day. And my first day as a father of a first grader. I'm not sure who was more excited, me or her. I can't wait to hear what she has to say about the school. Was it fun? Did she get new friends? I'm also looking forward to the first parent teacher events. I don't know why because we've had these in the kindergarten already. Maybe there's something about my girl growing up. Being more independent every day. But still she will be my little girl forever.
