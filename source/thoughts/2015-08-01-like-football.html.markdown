title: Like football
---

My eldest started a hobby this summer. Football. She learned that a friend of hers is on a new team in this area. My wife took a chance and brought her to the training. And they were taking new players. She's been playing for almost two months now and they hade their first practice games. I went to see how they play. There was a lot of running after the ball. But it wasn't really football. Not yet. It did resemble football. But they had fun. And that's the main reason for hobbies. They have time to learn.
