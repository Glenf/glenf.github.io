title: A goodbye
---

Our oldest dog Iida is 13 years old. She is old for a labrador retriever. And her body is giving up on her. She still has her mind sharp as ever. But her joints are broken. She has been eating pain killers for a couple of years now. When she started eating them she got her spirit and joy back. But recently we've started to think if it's her time to go. The pain killers aren√§t fixing her. Just easing the pain. So every pain killer I give to her feels like a small goodbye. And it's hard to say goodbye to someone who's been in your life for a long time. Even if she is a dog. And especially when you are the one making the decision.
