title: Cost is relative
---

As a home owner I've learned that things tend to cost. Some things cost more than others. We had to replace our oil tank last year and it ate our vacation budjet. We weren't prepared for it. But luckily our old oil tank was found faulty before any oil was leaked. It would have cost us a lot more. This summer I'm repainting our roof. Another bigger cost. But couple of years ahead without repainting and our roof might need a replacement. About ten times the cost. Some times it helps to thing about the alternative cost.
