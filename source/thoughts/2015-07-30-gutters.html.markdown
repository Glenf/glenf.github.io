# Gutters

Today started the last phase of my summer vacation roof maintenance. I dropped down our houses old gutters. I'm guessing those are original which makes them 47 years old. Or maybe they have been replaced at some point but that must be at least two decades ago. The gutters were rusty and the paint was shattered. I'll have to change a few bad boards and paint them before the new gutters can be installed. If it wont rain I'll have most of the boards installed and painted in a few days. But we all know how plans work out.
