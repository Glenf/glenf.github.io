Well that went as planned. My friday I mean. I left work for a weekend and thought I'd fix the carburettor of my lawnmower. I got home and didn't see my kids around. My wife told that we're taking the night off. And we're going to see some stand-up. She'd bought the tickets about a month ago. My jaw dropped. She'd been keeping that as a secret! For a month! So my work week ended with a lot of laughter. I had a wonderful evening in a good company. I did manage to fix the carb tho.
