title: Work

I started my work this week. Four weeks of vacation is over. And it's time to do things that I get paid for. Mostly the same things I'd do anyways. Writing code, solving problems. I feel I'm privileged to work in industry where I can combine one of my hobbies and improve it. As a professional I get paid to solve my clients problems. As a hobbyist I can use cutting edge libraries to do specific stuff. I learn new stuff from my co-workers. And sometimes I can implement stuff I've fiddled with to a specific client problem.
