We went hiking yesterday. Only for a few hours but still. We had our youngest dog with us and she was enjoying it. It was a short hike mainly because of a thunder and rain. For a part of the rain we held shelter in a small hut. We made some coffee in a campfire. I do love campfire. There's something soothing about the sound of a fire. And the coffee made with open fire can't be compared to anything else. It doesn't really taste any better. But it's the ritual that counts. It's what makes the coffee enjoyable.
