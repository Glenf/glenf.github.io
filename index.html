<p>
Every now and then comes a movie or a tv show that surprises me completely. The Matrix was one. Cloud Atlas was another. And now Mr. Robot. What gets me in these is that I&rsquo;ve got some sort of expectation but I still don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll see or get. In Mr. Robot I really enjoy how real the hacking feels. I din&rsquo;t see that coming. Especially after what Hollywood has done to it. Also this series makes me feel completely unsafe. It&rsquo;s not because of the hackers but because of the companies I trust my data with.

I like driving cars. And I like darkness. So driving in the dark is one of the greatest things I can do. Yesterday I drove from Rovaniemi to Oulu with my family. We left in the evening after our kids had eaten their porridge. After about an hour the back seat had quieted down and my wife had also closed her eyes. I was all alone in the car. The radio played something in the background. In a way this moment was one of the best things that had happened to me in a while. And I enjoyed it.

I started a new project. It&rsquo;s the kind what has to be done on clients hardware. So I recieved a new MacBook Pro. 2015 with force touch and the new keyboard. I&rsquo;ve been using it for couple of days now but there&rsquo;s something in the feel that is off. The previous MBP keyboard wasn&rsquo;t that good coding keyboard and this new one feels even more wrong. And the clickless click on the new trackpad. There is something weird about how it works. I might be over sensitive on this subject but sometimes things just don&rsquo;t click. Pun intended.

<p>
I enjoy listening to podcasts. I think podcasts are like talk radio except the program is targeted better at your interests. But creating podcasts is even more enjoyable. I can share my ideas with other people. Usually it&rsquo;s only with my co-host. But I do hope there are other people also who enjoy listening us talking. I really don&rsquo;t care how many there are because I&rsquo;m not doing this because of a large audience. The only thing I care is that maybe someone listening gets atleast some of the enthusiasm or spark I have for web development.

Our oldest dog Iida is 13 years old. She is old for a labrador retriever. And her body is giving up on her. She still has her mind sharp as ever. But her joints are broken. She has been eating pain killers for a couple of years now. When she started eating them she got her spirit and joy back. But recently we’ve started to think if it’s her time to go. The pain killers arenät fixing her. Just easing the pain. So every pain killer I give to her feels like a small goodbye. And it’s hard to say goodbye to someone who’s been in your life for a long time. Even if she is a dog. And especially when you

<p>
I have hard time to finish my projects. Not the work kind but the hobby and side project kind. I usually start them with enthusiasm but if the project takes a long time or gets lots of interruptions I tend to not finish it. Which is a bad thing. And I&rsquo;ve started to pay attention to it. Which has made me feel guilty. And it doesn&rsquo;t really help me finish the project. Recently I&rsquo;ve started to finish my projects. I&rsquo;t might have something to do with the fact that I don&rsquo;t want to feel guilty or bad anymore.
