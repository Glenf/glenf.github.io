As I mentioned previously we are repainting our roof. I&rsquo;m not sure if our roof has ever been repainted or if the paint job has just been fixed here and there. Anyway a 47 year old roof deserves a repaint. So yesterday was all about cleaning. 180 square meters of tin roof. Cleaning with pressure washer, brushing with detergent which includes a fair amount of ammonium, rinsing with water and scraping all rust out. Fortunately I got help from my brother and my sisters partner. Still it took 15 hours to get a clean roof. Now it&rsquo;s painting time.

As a home owner I&rsquo;ve learned that things tend to cost. Some things cost more than others. We had to replace our oil tank last year and it ate our vacation budjet. We weren&rsquo;t prepared for it. But luckily our old oil tank was found faulty before any oil was leaked. It would have cost us a lot more. This summer I&rsquo;m repainting our roof. Another bigger cost. But couple of years ahead without repainting and our roof might need a replacement. About ten times the cost. Some times it helps to thing about the alternative cost.

Yesterday was a nice day. Sun was shining and there was a little breeze. Just enough to keep those pesky little mosquitos away. And I was on the roof building a casting mold to our chimney crown. It was a simple but time consuming thing to do. Mainly because I&rsquo;m an amateur in doing stuff like this. I learn as I go. I the same at work. I know something and learn from there. The key thing in learning is to fail fast. Then you have the time to fix things. And do it right in future.

I&rsquo;m a concerned dad. My oldest is seven years old. She can do things with her own. Without me looking after her. She is a bit shy which I think is a good thing. I don&rsquo;t have to be that concerned. But still every time she goes to her friend I&rsquo;m a bit worried about the things that might happen. I think it&rsquo;s just a part of parenthood and me learning things. I might give her my old iPhone so I could track her. But no! I should let her have independece in her own little world. Without tracking.

Some days just don&rsquo;t start. First it&rsquo;s morning and suddenly it&rsquo;s late afternoon. And you wonder where did the day go. It happened to me once again. Fired up PS4 an playde Minecraft with kids for about two hours. But not to worry, my wife had a day off from work. She forced me to do real things. So I had to put my work trousers on and get out. I got our chimney finished. Only the crown is missing. Also got our Renault yearly maintenance done. Changed oils and filters. Now she&rsquo;ll run for another year.

Yesterday was a rainy day. It didn&rsquo;t rain much. It was a drizzle. But still enough to keep me and my kids inside. We watched some Netflix. Kids painted with watercolours. And I tried to find a web ui for Github pages. Then we went to the hardware store to get some more mortar. And to a computer store. I bought a second controller to my PS4. And Minecraft. I&rsquo;ve never played Minecraft but my seven year old daughter said it&rsquo;s good. Now it&rsquo;s waiting in the shelf to be opened and played. So just another normal day.
