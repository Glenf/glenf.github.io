My eldest started a hobby this summer. Football. She learned that a friend of hers is on a new team in this area. My wife took a chance and brought her to the training. And they were taking new players. She&rsquo;s been playing for almost two months now and they hade their first practice games. I went to see how they play. There was a lot of running after the ball. But it wasn&rsquo;t really football. Not yet. It did resemble football. But they had fun. And that&rsquo;s the main reason for hobbies. They have time to learn.

I&rsquo;d want to call myself a gamer. But really I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m more like a spectator. I like to watch other people play games. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I do like to play also. But mostly with someone else. Throught network or in the same room. At the same time or in turns. The games I like the most are co-ops. You&rsquo;re both doing things for common purpose. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I suck at the game. I think this is mainly because I got my first console last christmas. Before that my gaming was very casual.

</header>
<section class='post-excerpt'>
<p>
Today started the last phase of my summer vacation roof maintenance. I dropped down our houses old gutters. I&rsquo;m guessing those are original which makes them 47 years old. Or maybe they have been replaced at some point but that must be at least two decades ago. The gutters were rusty and the paint was shattered. I&rsquo;ll have to change a few bad boards and paint them before the new gutters can be installed. If it wont rain I&rsquo;ll have most of the boards installed and painted in a few days. But we all know how plans work out.

<section class='post-excerpt'>
<p>
I got a riding lawn mower for free. A Murray 5/25. I think it&rsquo;s from the 80&rsquo;s or something. It has been neglected for a while and was looking a bit out of shape. One tire was flat, back tires didn&rsquo;t turn freely, engine didn&rsquo;t start and it was dirty all over. Before I&rsquo;d fix anythin else I&rsquo;d had to get it running. So I did a little cleanup and checked that the engine got spark. Then I removed the air cleaner and tried to start the engine. It did run. Very loudly. Next up, gearbox maintenance.

<p>
My last summer vacation week has started. It&rsquo;s weird how the time just flies. When there&rsquo;s lots of stuff to do you don&rsquo;t count the days. Now that I&rsquo;ve done most of the things I was supposed to to on my summer vacation I have time to count the remaining days. Which is not that bad. I&rsquo;m already waiting to return to work. A promising new project and lots of ideas. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have time to finish the stuff I started before I&rsquo;ll start my work. But then again, there are always weekends to do the finishing touches.

<p>
We have three dogs. Labrador retrievers. Fun dogs. Most of the times. Some times they do annoying stuff like eat socks or vormit to a carpet. But that&rsquo;s just how they are. The old ones, 13 and 10 years are getting slow. But the youngest one, one year old is just starting her life. Her name is Lysti. As name suggests she&rsquo;s full of joy, energy and wants to please. Every time we go for a walk she puts her nose down to the ground and starts sniffing. Someone has said that dogs eases stress. Most times that&rsquo;s true.
