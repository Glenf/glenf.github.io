    <summary type="html">Summer is ending and the fall is coming. And I have a car fever. It&amp;rsquo;s partly because couple of my coworkers have or are changing cars. The second reason is my current car, Mitsubishi. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it for almost two years now. It&amp;rsquo;s a good car but I tend to change my cars in around three years. There are few exceptions. But my Mitsubishi, it&amp;rsquo;s starting to cost a bit too much. For an 800€ car a 400€ repair seems too much. Then again, 400€ or 5000€ for a car. That&amp;rsquo;s the maths I should be consentrating to.

    <summary type="html">My daughter started her school. First half a week went fine. But first monday with new schedule was something new. An hour later and straight to classroom was a bit too much. There was no-one outside to take her inside. So she paniced a little She rode her bike back to home and called my wife who called me to help. I called her and told to go back to school. I drove to her school from work and calmed her down. Then I explained the situation to her teacher. It all went well from there.

    <summary type="html">I do web stuff for living. It&amp;rsquo;s my job and hobby. But sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to do something that leaves a physical object behind. That&amp;rsquo;s why I like to do stuff. Build, fix or tinker with stuff. Hopefully these things  take only a day or two. As a house owner there are maintenance things I need to do but I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about those things. I&amp;rsquo;m talking things like a tool holder on the wall or a Nexus 7 dock. I&amp;rsquo;m not doing these because there&amp;rsquo;s need. I&amp;rsquo;m doing them because it takes my mind off of something else.

    <summary type="html">When I got my first phone I was 15 years old. The phone was Motorola MicroTAC. NMT phone. And when I got it it was already 5 years old. It was awesome. I could call all my friends if they had mobile phones. Some even had GSM phones, Nokias that could send text messages. My poor Moto didn&amp;rsquo;t have that feature. My daughter got my old iPhone 4s. She&amp;rsquo;s seven. And she has a phone that can do more than my computer back when I got my first phone. The times have truly changed. And that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.

    <summary type="html">I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a break after I do this. In a sec. Just a little moment and then I&amp;rsquo;ll go. And that moment stretches to an hour or two. And the posture is all wrong because of all the sitting in the edge of the seat. Spine all twisted. Shoulders collapsed. I know my muscles will ache later but I don&amp;rsquo;t really pay attention to my body. Or outside world. The Flow has me. Code comes easily. Making awesome things. Only thing breaking the Flow is calendar alarm reminding me to pick my kids up after work.

    <summary type="html">My daughter went to first grade today. This is her first school day. And my first day as a father of a first grader. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who was more excited, me or her. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to hear what she has to say about the school. Was it fun? Did she get new friends? I&amp;rsquo;m also looking forward to the first parent teacher events. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why because we&amp;rsquo;ve had these in the kindergarten already. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something about my girl growing up. Being more independent every day. But still she will be my little girl forever.
